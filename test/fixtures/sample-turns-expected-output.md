I'll help you with this task. Let me start by examining the file to understand what needs to be changed.

### 🔧 `Read`

}
```

**Result:**

    return "Hello World"

if __name__ == "__main__":

```

  "file_path": "/path/to/sample/file.py",
  "old_string": "def example_function():\n    print(\"Debug message\")  # This should be removed\n    return \"Hello World\"",
  "new_string": "def example_function():\n    return \"Hello World\""
}
```

**→** File successfully edited. The debug print statement has been removed.
