![Claude Code Action responding to a comment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d60c2e9-82ed-4ee5-b749-f9e021c85f4d)

# Claude Code Action

A general-purpose [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action listens for a trigger phrase in comments and activates Claude act on the request. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

## Features

- 🤖 **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- 🔍 **Code Review**: Analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements
- ✨ **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- 💬 **PR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub comments and PR reviews
- 🛠️ **Flexible Tool Access**: Access to GitHub APIs and file operations (additional tools can be enabled via configuration)
- 📋 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with checkboxes that dynamically update as Claude completes tasks
- 🏃 **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: The action executes entirely on your own GitHub runner (Anthropic API calls go to your chosen provider)

## Quickstart

The easiest way to set up this action is through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in the terminal. Just open `claude` and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

**Note**:

- You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
- This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. If you're using AWS Bedrock, please see the instructions below.

### Manual Setup (Direct API)

**Requirements**: You must be a repository admin to complete these steps.

1. Install the Claude GitHub app to your repository: https://github.com/apps/claude
2. Add authentication to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)):
   - Either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for API key authentication
   - Or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for OAuth token authentication (Pro and Max users can generate this by running `claude setup-token` locally)
3. Copy the workflow file from [`examples/claude.yml`](./examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`

### Using a Custom GitHub App

If you prefer not to install the official Claude app, you can create your own GitHub App to use with this action. This gives you complete control over permissions and access.

**When you may want to use a custom GitHub App:**

- You need more restrictive permissions than the official app
- Organization policies prevent installing third-party apps
- You're using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI

**Steps to create and use a custom GitHub App:**

1. **Create a new GitHub App:**

   - Go to https://github.com/settings/apps (for personal apps) or your organization's settings
   - Click "New GitHub App"
   - Configure the app with these minimum permissions:
     - **Repository permissions:**
       - Contents: Read & Write
       - Issues: Read & Write
       - Pull requests: Read & Write
     - **Account permissions:** None required
   - Set "Where can this GitHub App be installed?" to your preference
   - Create the app

2. **Generate and download a private key:**

   - After creating the app, scroll down to "Private keys"
   - Click "Generate a private key"
   - Download the `.pem` file (keep this secure!)

3. **Install the app on your repository:**

   - Go to the app's settings page
   - Click "Install App"
   - Select the repositories where you want to use Claude

4. **Add the app credentials to your repository secrets:**

   - Go to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add these secrets:
     - `APP_ID`: Your GitHub App's ID (found in the app settings)
     - `APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: The contents of the downloaded `.pem` file

5. **Update your workflow to use the custom app:**

   ```yaml
   name: Claude with Custom App
   on:
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]
     # ... other triggers

   jobs:
     claude-response:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         # Generate a token from your custom app
         - name: Generate GitHub App token
           id: app-token
           uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
           with:
             app-id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
             private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

         # Use Claude with your custom app's token
         - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
           with:
             anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
             github_token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
             # ... other configuration
   ```

**Important notes:**

- The custom app must have read/write permissions for Issues, Pull Requests, and Contents
- Your app's token will have the exact permissions you configured, nothing more

For more information on creating GitHub Apps, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps).

> **Note**: This action is currently in beta. Features and APIs may change as we continue to improve the integration.

### Using Custom MCP Configuration

The `mcp_config` input allows you to add custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend Claude's capabilities. These servers merge with the built-in GitHub MCP servers.

#### Basic Example: Adding a Sequential Thinking Server

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "sequential-thinking": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
              "-y",
              "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    allowed_tools: "mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking" # Important: Each MCP tool from your server must be listed here, comma-separated
    # ... other inputs
```

#### Passing Secrets to MCP Servers

For MCP servers that require sensitive information like API keys or tokens, use GitHub Secrets in the environment variables:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "custom-api-server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@example/api-server"],
            "env": {
              "API_KEY": "${{ secrets.CUSTOM_API_KEY }}",
              "BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    # ... other inputs
```

#### Using Python MCP Servers with uv

For Python-based MCP servers managed with `uv`, you need to specify the directory containing your server:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    mcp_config: |
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "my-python-server": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
              "--directory",
              "${{ github.workspace }}/path/to/server/",
              "run",
              "server_file.py"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    allowed_tools: "my-python-server__<tool_name>" # Replace <tool_name> with your server's tool names
    # ... other inputs
```

For example, if your Python MCP server is at `mcp_servers/weather.py`, you would use:

```yaml
"args":
  ["--directory", "${{ github.workspace }}/mcp_servers/", "run", "weather.py"]
```

**Important**:

- Always use GitHub Secrets (`${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`) for sensitive values like API keys, tokens, or passwords. Never hardcode secrets directly in the workflow file.
- Your custom servers will override any built-in servers with the same name.

## Examples

### Ways to Tag @claude

These examples show how to interact with Claude using comments in PRs and issues. By default, Claude will be triggered anytime you mention `@claude`, but you can customize the exact trigger phrase using the `trigger_phrase` input in the workflow.

Claude will see the full PR context, including any comments.

#### Ask Questions

Add a comment to a PR or issue:

```
@claude What does this function do and how could we improve it?
```

Claude will analyze the code and provide a detailed explanation with suggestions.

#### Request Fixes

Ask Claude to implement specific changes:

```
@claude Can you add error handling to this function?
```

#### Code Review

Get a thorough review:

```
@claude Please review this PR and suggest improvements
```

Claude will analyze the changes and provide feedback.

#### Fix Bugs from Screenshots

Upload a screenshot of a bug and ask Claude to fix it:

```
@claude Here's a screenshot of a bug I'm seeing [upload screenshot]. Can you fix it?
```

Claude can see and analyze images, making it easy to fix visual bugs or UI issues.

### Custom Automations

These examples show how to configure Claude to act automatically based on GitHub events, without requiring manual @mentions.

#### Supported GitHub Events

This action supports the following GitHub events ([learn more GitHub event triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows)):

- `pull_request` - When PRs are opened or synchronized
- `issue_comment` - When comments are created on issues or PRs
- `pull_request_comment` - When comments are made on PR diffs
- `issues` - When issues are opened or assigned
- `pull_request_review` - When PR reviews are submitted
- `pull_request_review_comment` - When comments are made on PR reviews
- `repository_dispatch` - Custom events triggered via API (coming soon)
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual workflow triggers (coming soon)

#### Automated Documentation Updates

Automatically update documentation when specific files change (see [`examples/claude-pr-path-specific.yml`](./examples/claude-pr-path-specific.yml)):

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "src/api/**/*.ts"

steps:
  - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
    with:
      direct_prompt: |
        Update the API documentation in README.md to reflect
        the changes made to the API endpoints in this PR.
```

When API files are modified, Claude automatically updates your README with the latest endpoint documentation and pushes the changes back to the PR, keeping your docs in sync with your code.

#### Author-Specific Code Reviews

Automatically review PRs from specific authors or external contributors (see [`examples/claude-review-from-author.yml`](./examples/claude-review-from-author.yml)):

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review-by-author:
    if: |
      github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'developer1' ||
      github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'external-contributor'
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          direct_prompt: |
            Please provide a thorough review of this pull request.
            Pay extra attention to coding standards, security practices,
            and test coverage since this is from an external contributor.
```

Perfect for automatically reviewing PRs from new team members, external contributors, or specific developers who need extra guidance.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger Detection**: Listens for comments containing the trigger phrase (default: `@claude`) or issue assignment to a specific user
2. **Context Gathering**: Analyzes the PR/issue, comments, code changes
3. **Smart Responses**: Either answers questions or implements changes
4. **Branch Management**: Creates new PRs for human authors, pushes directly for Claude's own PRs
5. **Communication**: Posts updates at every step to keep you informed

This action is built on top of [`anthropics/claude-code-base-action`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-base-action).

## Capabilities and Limitations

### What Claude Can Do

- **Respond in a Single Comment**: Claude operates by updating a single initial comment with progress and results
- **Answer Questions**: Analyze code and provide explanations
- **Implement Code Changes**: Make simple to moderate code changes based on requests
- **Prepare Pull Requests**: Creates commits on a branch and links back to a prefilled PR creation page
- **Perform Code Reviews**: Analyze PR changes and provide detailed feedback
- **Smart Branch Handling**:
  - When triggered on an **issue**: Always creates a new branch for the work
  - When triggered on an **open PR**: Always pushes directly to the existing PR branch
  - When triggered on a **closed PR**: Creates a new branch since the original is no longer active
- **View GitHub Actions Results**: Can access workflow runs, job logs, and test results on the PR where it's tagged when `actions: read` permission is configured (see [Additional Permissions for CI/CD Integration](#additional-permissions-for-cicd-integration))

### What Claude Cannot Do

- **Submit PR Reviews**: Claude cannot submit formal GitHub PR reviews
- **Approve PRs**: For security reasons, Claude cannot approve pull requests
- **Post Multiple Comments**: Claude only acts by updating its initial comment
- **Execute Commands Outside Its Context**: Claude only has access to the repository and PR/issue context it's triggered in
- **Run Arbitrary Bash Commands**: By default, Claude cannot execute Bash commands unless explicitly allowed using the `allowed_tools` configuration
- **Perform Branch Operations**: Cannot merge branches, rebase, or perform other git operations beyond pushing commits

## Advanced Configuration

### Additional Permissions for CI/CD Integration

The `additional_permissions` input allows Claude to access GitHub Actions workflow information when you grant the necessary permissions. This is particularly useful for analyzing CI/CD failures and debugging workflow issues.

#### Enabling GitHub Actions Access

To allow Claude to view workflow run results, job logs, and CI status:

1. **Grant the necessary permission to your GitHub token**:

   - When using the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, add the `actions: read` permission to your workflow:

   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write
     pull-requests: write
     issues: write
     actions: read # Add this line
   ```

2. **Configure the action with additional permissions**:

   ```yaml
   - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
     with:
       anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
       additional_permissions: |
         actions: read
       # ... other inputs
   ```

3. **Claude will automatically get access to CI/CD tools**:
   When you enable `actions: read`, Claude can use the following MCP tools:
   - `mcp__github_ci__get_ci_status` - View workflow run statuses
   - `mcp__github_ci__get_workflow_run_details` - Get detailed workflow information
   - `mcp__github_ci__download_job_log` - Download and analyze job logs

#### Example: Debugging Failed CI Runs

```yaml
name: Claude CI Helper
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  actions: read # Required for CI access

jobs:
  claude-ci-helper:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          additional_permissions: |
            actions: read
          # Now Claude can respond to "@claude why did the CI fail?"
```

**Important Notes**:

- The GitHub token must have the `actions: read` permission in your workflow
- If the permission is missing, Claude will warn you and suggest adding it
- Currently, only `actions: read` is supported, but the format allows for future extensions

### Custom Environment Variables

You can pass custom environment variables to Claude Code execution using the `claude_env` input. This is useful for CI/test setups that require specific environment variables:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    claude_env: |
      NODE_ENV: test
      CI: true
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://test:test@localhost:5432/test_db
    # ... other inputs
```

The `claude_env` input accepts YAML format where each line defines a key-value pair. These environment variables will be available to Claude Code during execution, allowing it to run tests, build processes, or other commands that depend on specific environment configurations.

### Limiting Conversation Turns

You can use the `max_turns` parameter to limit the number of back-and-forth exchanges Claude can have during task execution. This is useful for:

- Controlling costs by preventing runaway conversations
- Setting time boundaries for automated workflows
- Ensuring predictable behavior in CI/CD pipelines

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    max_turns: "5" # Limit to 5 conversation turns
    # ... other inputs
```

When the turn limit is reached, Claude will stop execution gracefully. Choose a value that gives Claude enough turns to complete typical tasks while preventing excessive usage.

### Custom Tools

By default, Claude only has access to:

- File operations (reading, committing, editing files, read-only git commands)
- Comment management (creating/updating comments)
- Basic GitHub operations

Claude does **not** have access to execute arbitrary Bash commands by default. If you want Claude to run specific commands (e.g., npm install, npm test), you must explicitly allow them using the `allowed_tools` configuration:

**Note**: If your repository has a `.mcp.json` file in the root directory, Claude will automatically detect and use the MCP server tools defined there. However, these tools still need to be explicitly allowed via the `allowed_tools` configuration.

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    allowed_tools: |
      Bash(npm install)
      Bash(npm run test)
      Edit
      Replace
      NotebookEditCell
    disallowed_tools: |
      TaskOutput
      KillTask
    # ... other inputs
```

**Note**: The base GitHub tools are always included. Use `allowed_tools` to add additional tools (including specific Bash commands), and `disallowed_tools` to prevent specific tools from being used.

### Custom Model

Use a specific Claude model:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    # model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"  # Optional: specify a different model
    # ... other inputs
```

### Network Restrictions

For enhanced security, you can restrict Claude's network access to specific domains only. This feature is particularly useful for:

- Enterprise environments with strict security policies
- Preventing access to external services
- Limiting Claude to only your internal APIs and services

When `experimental_allowed_domains` is set, Claude can only access the domains you explicitly list. You'll need to include the appropriate provider domains based on your authentication method.

#### Provider-Specific Examples

##### If using Anthropic API or subscription

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    # Or: claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
    experimental_allowed_domains: |
      .anthropic.com
```

##### If using AWS Bedrock

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    use_bedrock: "true"
    experimental_allowed_domains: |
      bedrock.*.amazonaws.com
      bedrock-runtime.*.amazonaws.com
```

##### If using Google Vertex AI

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    use_vertex: "true"
    experimental_allowed_domains: |
      *.googleapis.com
      vertexai.googleapis.com
```

#### Common GitHub Domains

In addition to your provider domains, you may need to include GitHub-related domains. For GitHub.com users, common domains include:

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    experimental_allowed_domains: |
      .anthropic.com  # For Anthropic API
      .github.com
      .githubusercontent.com
      ghcr.io
      .blob.core.windows.net
```

For GitHub Enterprise users, replace the GitHub.com domains above with your enterprise domains (e.g., `.github.company.com`, `packages.company.com`, etc.).

To determine which domains your workflow needs, you can temporarily run without restrictions and monitor the network requests, or check your GitHub Enterprise configuration for the specific services you use.

### Claude Code Settings

You can provide Claude Code settings to customize behavior such as model selection, environment variables, permissions, and hooks. Settings can be provided either as a JSON string or a path to a settings file.

#### Option 1: Settings File

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    settings: "path/to/settings.json"
    # ... other inputs
```

#### Option 2: Inline Settings

```yaml
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    settings: |
      {
        "model": "claude-opus-4-20250514",
        "env": {
          "DEBUG": "true",
          "API_URL": "https://api.example.com"
        },
        "permissions": {
          "allow": ["Bash", "Read"],
          "deny": ["WebFetch"]
        },
        "hooks": {
          "PreToolUse": [{
            "matcher": "Bash",
            "hooks": [{
              "type": "command",
              "command": "echo Running bash command..."
            }]
          }]
        }
      }
    # ... other inputs
```

The settings support all Claude Code settings options including:

- `model`: Override the default model
- `env`: Environment variables for the session
- `permissions`: Tool usage permissions
- `hooks`: Pre/post tool execution hooks
- And more...

For a complete list of available settings and their descriptions, see the [Claude Code settings documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings).

**Notes**:

- The `enableAllProjectMcpServers` setting is always set to `true` by this action to ensure MCP servers work correctly.
- If both the `model` input parameter and a `model` in settings are provided, the `model` input parameter takes precedence.
- The `allowed_tools` and `disallowed_tools` input parameters take precedence over `permissions` in settings.
- In a future version, we may deprecate individual input parameters in favor of using the settings file for all configuration.

## Cloud Providers

You can authenticate with Claude using any of these three methods:

1. Direct Anthropic API (default)
2. Amazon Bedrock with OIDC authentication
3. Google Vertex AI with OIDC authentication

For detailed setup instructions for AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI, see the [official documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/github-actions#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai).

**Note**:

- Bedrock and Vertex use OIDC authentication exclusively
- AWS Bedrock automatically uses cross-region inference profiles for certain models
- For cross-region inference profile models, you need to request and be granted access to the Claude models in all regions that the inference profile uses

### Model Configuration

Use provider-specific model names based on your chosen provider:

```yaml
# For direct Anthropic API (default)
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    # ... other inputs

# For Amazon Bedrock with OIDC
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    model: "anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-beta:0" # Cross-region inference
    use_bedrock: "true"
    # ... other inputs

# For Google Vertex AI with OIDC
- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    model: "claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219"
    use_vertex: "true"
    # ... other inputs
```

### OIDC Authentication for Bedrock and Vertex

Both AWS Bedrock and GCP Vertex AI require OIDC authentication.

```yaml
# For AWS Bedrock with OIDC
- name: Configure AWS Credentials (OIDC)
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}
    aws-region: us-west-2

- name: Generate GitHub App token
  id: app-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    model: "anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-beta:0"
    use_bedrock: "true"
    # ... other inputs

  permissions:
    id-token: write # Required for OIDC
```

```yaml
# For GCP Vertex AI with OIDC
- name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
  with:
    workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER }}
    service_account: ${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}

- name: Generate GitHub App token
  id: app-token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}

- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
  with:
    model: "claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219"
    use_vertex: "true"
    # ... other inputs

  permissions:
    id-token: write # Required for OIDC
```

## Security

### Access Control

- **Repository Access**: The action can only be triggered by users with write access to the repository
- **No Bot Triggers**: GitHub Apps and bots cannot trigger this action
- **Token Permissions**: The GitHub app receives only a short-lived token scoped specifically to the repository it's operating in
- **No Cross-Repository Access**: Each action invocation is limited to the repository where it was triggered
- **Limited Scope**: The token cannot access other repositories or perform actions beyond the configured permissions

### GitHub App Permissions

The [Claude Code GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/claude) requires these permissions:

- **Pull Requests**: Read and write to create PRs and push changes
- **Issues**: Read and write to respond to issues
- **Contents**: Read and write to modify repository files

### Commit Signing

All commits made by Claude through this action are automatically signed with commit signatures. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of commits, providing a verifiable trail of changes made by the action.

### ⚠️ Authentication Protection

**CRITICAL: Never hardcode your Anthropic API key or OAuth token in workflow files!**

Your authentication credentials must always be stored in GitHub secrets to prevent unauthorized access:

```yaml
# CORRECT ✅
anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
# OR
claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}

# NEVER DO THIS ❌
anthropic_api_key: "sk-ant-api03-..." # Exposed and vulnerable!
claude_code_oauth_token: "oauth_token_..." # Exposed and vulnerable!
```

### Setting Up GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository's Settings
2. Click on "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. For authentication, choose one:
   - API Key: Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, Value: Your Anthropic API key (starting with `sk-ant-`)
   - OAuth Token: Name: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, Value: Your Claude Code OAuth token (Pro and Max users can generate this by running `claude setup-token` locally)
5. Click "Add secret"

### Best Practices for Authentication

1. ✅ Always use `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}` or `${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}` in workflows
2. ✅ Never commit API keys or tokens to version control
3. ✅ Regularly rotate your API keys and tokens
4. ✅ Use environment secrets for organization-wide access
5. ❌ Never share API keys or tokens in pull requests or issues
6. ❌ Avoid logging workflow variables that might contain keys

## Security Best Practices

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never commit API keys directly to your repository! Always use GitHub Actions secrets.**

To securely use your Anthropic API key:

1. Add your API key as a repository secret:

   - Go to your repository's Settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name it `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - Paste your API key as the value

2. Reference the secret in your workflow:
   ```yaml
   anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
   ```

**Never do this:**

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Exposes your API key
anthropic_api_key: "sk-ant-..."
```

**Always do this:**

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Uses GitHub secrets
anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

This applies to all sensitive values including API keys, access tokens, and credentials.
We also recommend that you always use short-lived tokens when possible
